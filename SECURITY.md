# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The Black Skies project tracks the latest commit on the main branch. Security fixes will be applied on main and released in the next tagged build. No long-term support branches are maintained at this time.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please email security@black-skies.dev with the following details:

- A description of the vulnerability and potential impact
- Steps to reproduce the issue or proof-of-concept code
- Any suggested remediation or patches, if available

Please do **not** open a public issue for security concerns.

## Response Process

1. We will acknowledge receipt within five business days and establish a secure communication channel if needed.
2. Maintainers will investigate, prioritize the report, and work on a fix or mitigation.
3. Once a fix is ready, we will coordinate disclosure with the reporter and release notes will credit the reporter unless anonymity is requested.
4. After disclosure, we will update this policy if additional guidance is required.

Thank you for helping keep Black Skies users safe.
