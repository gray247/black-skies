# Phase 5 Work Folder

This folder contains **temporary, in-progress, experimental, and non-canonical** documents created during **Phase 5: Export & Integrity**.

Nothing in this folder is considered permanent documentation.

Use this space for:
- temp notes
- draft specs
- tests and logs
- pseudocode
- experiments
- scratch work
- diagrams
- partial implementations
- analysis or debugging

When Phase 5 is complete:
1. Move the entire `work/phase5/` folder into:  
   `archive/phase5/`
2. Promote only final, permanent documents into the main `docs/` directory  
   (e.g., `docs/io_spec.md`, `docs/integrity_rules.md`).

This process keeps the repository clean while preserving history.
