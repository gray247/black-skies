        text: "The radios stacked along the cellar shelves glowed a weak amber. Viki tapped the chassis of the closest set and heard only water gnashing in the vents above. The relay rack hissed, drowning beneath the rising groundwater.\n\nShe pulled the panel and slid into the crawlspace. Cables sagged like kelp. Every meter of slack meant another neighbor she could not reach. When the second surge slammed the outer doors, the concrete shuddered through her knees. The storm was already clawing for the roof joists.\n\nViki clipped the bypass coupler into place. The static cracked, then threaded into a faint SOS from Harbor Tower. Someone topside was still aliveâ€”and running out of time."
