      The radios stacked along the cellar shelves glowed a weak amber. Viki tapped the chassis
      of the closest set and heard only water gnashing in the vents above. The relay rack hissed,
      drowning beneath the rising groundwater.

      She pulled the panel and slid into the crawlspace. Cables sagged like kelp. Every meter of
      slack meant another neighbor she could not reach. When the second surge slammed the outer
      doors, the concrete shuddered through her knees. The storm was already clawing for the
      roof joists.

      Viki clipped the bypass coupler into place. The static cracked, then threaded into a faint
      SOS from Harbor Tower. Someone topside was still aliveâ€”and running out of time.

    summary: >-
      Strong POV anchoring and sensory detail sustain tension, but pacing softens mid-paragraph
      when the crawlspace description lingers.
    line_comments:
      - line: 6
        note: "Condense the crawlspace description to keep the rising water threat present."
      - line: 11
        note: "Clarify how the SOS differs from baseline static for higher contrast."
    priorities:
      - "Tighten crawlspace beat to two sentences."
      - "Highlight auditory shift when the SOS cuts through."
