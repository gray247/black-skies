**Status:** ACTIVE · 2025-09-29

Chronological record of locked decisions and spec/version bumps. One-line summary first, details after.

## 2025-10-28 Phase 8 docking verification (IN PROGRESS)
- Dock manager (react-mosaic) integrated via `DockWorkspace`; runtime config toggles docking and preset focus order.
- Layout persistence writes schema v2 payloads with floating pane metadata; renderer reopens saved windows and hotkeys cover presets plus focus cycling.
- Added Vitest coverage for layout bounds, logging redactors, and DockWorkspace hotkeys alongside pytest coverage for backup verifier includes and nested voice notes.
- docs/gui_layouts.md and docs/phase8_gui_enhancements.md updated with current scope, verification checklist, and outstanding manual QA items.

## 2025-10-22 Phase 8 GUI enhancements scope (LOCKED)
- Added Phase 8 planning entry covering IDE-style docking: drag/drop panes, floating windows, and saved layouts.
- docs/gui_layouts.md and docs/architecture.md clarify the locked preset layout and capture serialization/multi-monitor requirements for the upcoming customization work.

## 2025-10-07 — Phase 9/11 planning docs added (DRAFT)
- Added planning documents for backup verification daemon (T-9142), dashboard initiatives (T-9143), smart merge tooling (T-9144), offline cache manager (T-9145), and accessibility toggles (T-9146).
- docs/architecture.md, docs/phase_charter.md, docs/gui_layouts.md cross-link the new plans; CHANGELOG/RELEASE/support playbook updated for Phase 9 readiness.

## 2025-10-21 — Companion analytics & export summaries (LOCKED)

## 2025-09-29 — Milestone P4.1 release wrap (LOCKED)
- Refreshed documentation set for P4.1, ensuring roadmap, phase logs, and supporting docs are aligned.
- Cut release tag and noted the documentation sweep across milestones and supporting references.
- Verified CI pipelines and documentation build paths after the tagging pass.
- Verification report: [`docs/milestone_p4_1_verification.md`](docs/milestone_p4_1_verification.md).

## 2025-09-29 - Observability baseline (LOCKED)
- Added structured JSON logging with trace IDs for every request and error handler responses.

- Updated RUNBOOK with monitoring guidance for logs, trace IDs, and metrics consumption.

## 2025-09-29 - P0-P3 service refactor (LOCKED)
- Established the lightweight black_skies package with FastAPI endpoints (/outline, /draft, /rewrite, /critique) and unit tests (python -m pytest -q).
- Added storage, critique, export, run ledger, and cache modules with offline wheel manifest and constraints for sandboxed setup.
- Created settings, release/runbook docs, and populated vendor/wheels/ so scripts/setup and scripts/maint run without network access.

## 2025-09-28 — Milestone P1 locked (LOCKED)
- Verified P1.2 docs and renderer coverage; Vitest now pulls in `@testing-library/jest-dom` and passes via `pnpm --filter app test`.
- Confirmed service regressions with `PYTHONPATH=services/src python -m pytest` (17 passed) and budget warnings format lint fixes.
- Phase 1 Preflight milestone declared complete; roadmap advances to Critique Accept (P2.0).

## 2025-09-29 — Milestone P2 locked (LOCKED)
- Service: `/draft/accept` applies critique diffs, emits snapshots/manifest, and snapshot restore path covered by pytest (`services/tests/test_app.py`).
- Recovery: desktop surfaces banner + restore toast; Vitest ensures happy-path + cleanup (`app/renderer/__tests__/AppRecovery.test.tsx`).
- UI: critique accept/reject flows polished, history surfaced, renderer tests green via `pnpm --filter app test`.

## 2025-09-29 — Milestone P3.0 export pipeline (LOCKED)
- Export endpoint compiles `draft_full.md` with deterministic chapter/scene ordering and meta header toggle (`services/src/blackskies/services/app.py`).
- Snapshot persistence now emits `snapshot.yaml` manifests; pytest asserts export success/error + manifest fidelity (`services/tests/test_app.py`).
- Renderer + service suites verified via `corepack pnpm --filter app test` and `PYTHONPATH=services/src python -m pytest`.

## 2025-09-29 — Milestone P3.1 packaging (LOCKED)
- Added electron-builder configuration + scripts to emit NSIS installer and portable builds (`app/electron-builder.yml`, `app/package.json`).
- Main process now resolves packaged Python assets; Vite/tsc build pipeline compiles renderer + main before packaging (`app/main/main.ts`, `app/tsconfig.main.json`).

## 2025-09-17 — Phase-1 Definition of Done (LOCKED)
- Wizard: all steps functional; decisions **lock & snapshot**; restore from History works.
- Outline: builds **deterministically** from locked decisions (`OutlineSchema v1`).
- Draft: generate **3 scenes**; store **prompts & seeds** with outputs (`DraftUnitSchema v1`).
- Critique: rubric run; **diff** shown; **Accept/Rollback** applies hunks and snapshots (`CritiqueOutputSchema v1`).
- Export: `outline.json` and `draft_full.md` write without errors.
- Recovery: crash → next launch shows Recovery banner; reopen last project; view diagnostics.
- Performance: **15k–20k** scene edit < **150 ms** avg keystroke; initial diff < **500 ms**.
- Budgets: soft **$5** warn; hard **$10** block with `BUDGET_EXCEEDED`.
- A11y: keyboard path complete; reduced-motion supported; contrast & focus rings per policy.
- Packaging: NSIS installer + portable ZIP produced; app ID set; icons/splash present.

## 2025-09-17 — Platform lock (LOCKED)

## Change control
- Any spec change to **limits, budgets, schemas, error model, a11y, or platform** requires:
  1) Update the relevant doc(s) and bump **Version** if shape/behavior changes.
  2) Add a dated entry here with the new version(s) and a single-sentence rationale.

Template:
```
## YYYY-MM-DD — <change summary> (LOCKED|AMENDED)

- Rationale: <why>
- Notes: <migration/back-compat if any>
```
