# Milestone P4.1 Verification Report

This report closes out Milestone P4.1 (Documentation sweep & release tag). It lists the completion evidence for each acceptance criterion alongside follow-up verification commands.

## Summary
- All P4.1 scope documents now describe the live observability surface (`/api/v1/healthz`, `/api/v1/metrics`, and `x-trace-id` headers) and align with the released FastAPI behaviour.
- Release metadata is locked at `1.0.0+phase1` with CHANGELOG, roadmap, and phase logs updated to show the milestone as complete.
- Regression checks (`pytest -q`) and packaging validation (`python -m build --wheel --no-isolation`) succeeded for the tag.

## Detailed Checklist
| Step | Description | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | API docs refreshed | Complete | [`docs/endpoints.md`](endpoints.md) documents `/api/v1/healthz`, `/api/v1/metrics`, and the `trace_id` + `x-trace-id` error contract. |
| 2 | Architecture docs updated | Complete | [`docs/architecture.md`](architecture.md) calls out `/api/v1/healthz`, Prometheus metrics, and trace headers in the service overview. |
| 3 | Top-level README aligned | Complete | [`README.md`](../README.md) directs operators to `/api/v1/healthz`, `/api/v1/metrics`, and trace headers in the Observability section. |
| 4 | Runbook observability notes | Complete | [`RUNBOOK.md`](../RUNBOOK.md) includes `X-Trace-Id` guidance and `/api/v1/metrics` coverage for operators. |
| 5 | Roadmap & logs flipped to âœ… | Complete | [`docs/roadmap.md`](roadmap.md) and [`docs/phase_log.md`](phase_log.md) mark P4.1 complete with release notes. |
| 6 | Release metadata locked | Complete | [`pyproject.toml`](../pyproject.toml), [`black_skies/__init__.py`](../black_skies/__init__.py), and [`CHANGELOG.md`](../CHANGELOG.md) carry version `1.0.0+phase1`; annotated tag `v1.0.0-phase1` recorded in [`phase_log.md`](../phase_log.md). |
| 7 | Regression & packaging checks | Complete | [`phase_log.md`](../phase_log.md) captures successful `python -m pytest -q` and `python -m build --wheel --no-isolation` runs for the release. |

## Recommended Verification Commands
Run from the repository root with the virtual environment activated:

```bash
# Confirm unit tests remain green
pytest -q

# Rebuild wheels to match the documented release process
python -m build --wheel --no-isolation

# Inspect the release tag metadata
git show v1.0.0-phase1
```

## Follow-up
- Begin P5 tooling work once the verification commands above succeed in CI and local smoke tests.
- Update this report if any P4.1 artifacts (docs, version numbers, or release tag metadata) change in future patches.
