# Good Idea Fairy Backlog

Collects future ideas and deferred enhancements so the canonical planning surface stays focused on v1.1.  
*Legacy items from `docs/good_idea_fairies.md` have been migrated here for easier tracking.*

## Deferred capabilities (phase > P8)
- Voice Notes & Transcription workflows (`docs/deferred/voice_notes_transcription.md`)
- Plugin/Agent sandbox runtime + audit trails (`docs/specs/plugin_sandbox.md`)
- Backup verifier daemon UX and health payloads (`docs/specs/backup_verification_daemon.md`)
- Smart Merge tool for scene/chapter variants (`docs/deferred/smart_merge_tool.md`)
- Large-font & high-contrast toggles + export story bundling (`docs/gui/accessibility_toggles.md`, `docs/gui/exports.md`)
- Analytics dashboards (Movie: emotion arcs, pacing graphs) + Project Health widgets (`docs/phases/dashboard_initiatives.md`)

## Exploratory notes
- Floating-pane relocation toast details (see `docs/gui/gui_offline_insights_and_floats_plan.md`) need future automation.
- `docs/phases/phase_log.md` sections flagged TODOs (budget const reuse, fingerprint sorting, threadpool standardization) should move into tracked issues before Phase 11.

## Misc thoughts
- Capture `docs/idea_fairies` text? (Consider migrating to `docs/idea_backlog.md` before that doc drifts.)
- Keep `docs/ops/dev_ops_notes.md` updated with new troubleshooting kits; they belong on the ops/ side of the backlog.
