## 2025-11-15 – Phase 4 Verification Sweep
- Standardized Status/Version/Last Reviewed headers across every doc under `docs/`.
- Archived legacy review materials (Phase 8/9 findings, planning decks) under `docs/archive/reviews/` with a companion summary.
- Normalized archival metadata (`docs/archive/README.md`, folder notes) and reinforced the idea backlog & deferred surfaces.
- Updated cross-doc references (architecture, endpoints, GUI, analytics) to the new canonical locations (`docs/specs/`, `docs/gui/`).
- Documented the review cleanup in `docs/reviews/SUMMARY.md` and noted the Phase 4 completion in the stabilization plan.

## v1.0.1 — Phase 8 Documentation Fixes
- Removed the misleading TODO note from `docs/phases/README.md`.
- Promoted `docs/specs/backup_verification_daemon.md` to canonical Phase 11 status and reinforced its crosslinks.
- Extended the version manifest to include the backup daemon and the agent reading guide to reflect the canonical surface.
