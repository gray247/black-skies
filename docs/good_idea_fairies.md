# docs/good_idea_fairies.md — Futures Parking Lot

**Status:** NON-BINDING · IDEA PARKING ONLY  
**Purpose:** Capture ambitious, experimental, or out-of-scope ideas so they are not lost, without committing them to any current phase.

This doc is _not_ a roadmap. Items here are candidates for future phases only if/when they prove valuable, feasible, and compatible with core goals.

---

## Ground Rules

- Items here **do not** imply commitment.
- No feature is allowed to jump straight from here into implementation:
  - It must first graduate into:
    - `docs/phase_charter.md` (new phase or sub-phase), and
    - A proper spec (`docs/*.md`) if needed.
- This doc is allowed to be messy and imaginative, but must:
  - Name the idea
  - Specify rough value
  - Specify rough cost / risk

Format:

```text
### Idea Name
**Type:** UX | Engine | Integration | Analytics | Wild
**Value:** 
**Cost/Risk:**
**Rough Dependencies:**
**Notes:**
