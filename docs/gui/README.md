# GUI/UX Docs

Layouts, theming, accessibility toggles, exports, and Insights/offline handling live here.  
`gui_layouts.md` is the canonical layout spec; other docs in this folder extend it with theming, fix plans, accessibility, or export behaviors.  
Link each doc back to `docs/BUILD_PLAN.md` (TBD) to ensure UI deliverables map to implementation steps.

Canonical docs:
- `gui_layouts.md`
- `gui_theming.md`
- `accessibility_toggles.md`
- `gui_fix_plan.md`
- `gui_offline_insights_and_floats_plan.md`
- `exports.md`

Use this folder for renderer-facing spec updates; operational/offline notes belong in `docs/ops/` and experimental futures belong in `docs/deferred/`.
