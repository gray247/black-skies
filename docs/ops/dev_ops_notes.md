# Dev / Ops Notes

> A curated index of operational and troubleshooting docs so the team can find the right rescue kit quickly.

## Troubleshooting / Ops references

- [`docs/ops/start_codex_gui_notes.md`](./start_codex_gui_notes.md) – Explains how `start-codex.ps1` boots the stack, when it stalls, and how to launch the renderer/services manually if GUI windows never appear.
- [`docs/ops/gui_insights_rescue_kit.md`](./gui_insights_rescue_kit.md) – Packaged renderer rescue flow for the Insights Playwright spec plus the commands to rerun the kit with tracing.
- [`docs/ops/support_playbook.md`](./support_playbook.md) – Operational runbook for Phase 9 dashboards, analytics dashboards, durability signals, escalation channels, and post-release checklists.

Keep this file updated with any new one-off helpers so the rest of the team knows where to look when troubleshooting GUI or analytics regressions.
