# Code Review: fix: restore pydantic stub import guard

## Summary
- Reviewed changes in `services/tests/unit/test_snapshot_persistence_refactor.py` that modify the optional `pydantic` import stub.

## Findings
- :x: **Bug** â€“ The new stub assigns `ConfigDict = dict[str, Any]`, but this value is a `types.GenericAlias` and not callable. Code paths such as `ConfigDict(extra="forbid")` (used across the service models) will now raise `TypeError: 'types.GenericAlias' object is not callable` whenever the stub is activated (i.e., when `pydantic` is unavailable). Previously the tests only installed the stub when the package was missing, and the stub left `ConfigDict` undefined, so the failure was immediate and visible. The new implementation will silently create an unusable stub and mask legitimate dependency issues. The stub should instead provide a callable factory, e.g. `def ConfigDict(**kwargs: Any) -> dict[str, Any]: return kwargs`.

## Recommendation
- Replace the assignment with a callable helper so that the stub mirrors the behavior expected by the rest of the codebase and keeps the tests runnable when `pydantic` is absent.
