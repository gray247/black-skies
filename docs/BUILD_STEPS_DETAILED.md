# Build Steps Overview

The build steps are generated from structured metadata. Review:

- [docs/BUILD_STEPS_CHECKLIST.md](./BUILD_STEPS_CHECKLIST.md) for a table view (profiles, artifacts, commands).
- [docs/BUILD_STEPS_PLAYBOOK.md](./BUILD_STEPS_PLAYBOOK.md) for detailed descriptions and Codex prompts.

Regenerate these docs after editing docs/build_steps.json by running:

    python scripts/generate_build_steps_docs.py
