# Archived Docs

Superseded or historical documents live here for reference. They typically point to the current canonical doc (see e.g. the Playbook that superseded `BUILD_STEPS_CHECKLIST`).  
Keep this folder in sync with `docs/BUILD_PLAN.md` (TBD) so retired procedures are traceable.
Canonical docs:
- `BUILD_STEPS_CHECKLIST.md`
- `BUILD_STEPS_DETAILED.md`
- `P2_ACCEPT_PLAN.md`
- `reviews/` (archived review artifacts; see `../reviews/SUMMARY.md` for guidance)

Only store legacy materials here; current phase work belongs in `docs/phases/`, `docs/specs/`, or `docs/gui/`.
