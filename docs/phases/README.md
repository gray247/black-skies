# Phase Documentation

This folder holds the canonical charter and per-phase planning docs for P8–P11.  
Start with `phase_charter.md` as the Book of Record, then dive into the linked Phase 8–11 overlays (Phase 8 GUI docking, Phase 9 analytics/testplans, Phase 10 recovery, Phase 11 export).  
Every decision here should relate back to `docs/BUILD_PLAN.md` and `docs/roadmap.md` for scheduling context.

Canonical docs:
- `phase_charter.md`
- `phase_log.md`
- `phase8_gui_enhancements.md`
- `phase9_charter.md`
- `phase9_11_testplan.md`
- `phase9_companion_loop.md`
- `phase10_recovery_pipeline.md`
- `phase11_export_pipeline.md`
- `dashboard_initiatives.md`

Use this folder for active phase definitions; migrated or deferred explorations belong in `docs/deferred/`.
