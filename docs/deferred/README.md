# Deferred & Experimental

Future-facing or Phase >v1.1 docs go here. Each file includes a **Status: Deferred** header so the current release knows to ignore these plans unless their phase unlocks.  
Link each deferred doc back to the phase that will eventually own it via `docs/phases/phase_charter.md`, and ensure the canonical implementation path is recorded in `docs/BUILD_PLAN.md` (TBD).

Canonical docs:
- `voice_notes_transcription.md`
- `smart_merge_tool.md`

Keep new future ideas inside this folder until a phase charter promotes them; everything else belongs in `docs/specs/`, `docs/gui/`, or `docs/phases/`.
