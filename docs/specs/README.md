# Specs

Architecture, data schemas, endpoints, analytics, agent hooks, and related runtime specs live here.  
Each doc links back to `../phases/phase_charter.md` for phase context and must trace into `docs/BUILD_PLAN.md` (Future entry) for implementation tasks.

Canonical docs:
- `architecture.md`
- `data_model.md`
- `endpoints.md`
- `analytics_service_spec.md`
- `agents_and_services.md`
- `model_backend.md`
- `plugin_sandbox.md`
- `backup_verification_daemon.md`
- `performance_telemetry_policy.md`

Populate this folder with system-level books of record; anything not yet implemented or purely historical belongs under `docs/deferred/` or `docs/archive/`.
