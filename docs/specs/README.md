# Specs

Architecture, data schemas, endpoints, analytics, backup, plugin sandbox, performance targets, and adjacent runtime specs live here. Link back to `../phases/phase_charter.md` when interpreting the phase context, and respect the canonical order (architecture → data_model → endpoints → analytics) documented in each file.
